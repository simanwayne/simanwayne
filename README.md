**Introduction**\
Hey ðŸ‘‹, Iâ€™m Siman. I'm a passionate researcher working at the intersection of artificial intelligence, human behavior, and future focused technologies. My work is rooted in a simple but powerful belief: that intelligence, whether human or artificial, is more than logic or data. Itâ€™s about emotion, connection, and understanding. Thatâ€™s why I focus on areas like algorithmic love, predictive modeling, machine learning, neural networks, and the Internet of Things (IoT), all through a lens thatâ€™s deeply human centered.

During my PhD in Human Inspired AI from the University of Cambridge, I explored how machines can understand, replicate, and even support emotional processes, particularly in romantic and interpersonal relationships. Thatâ€™s where my work on algorithmic love began. I study how algorithms can model attraction, predict compatibility, and enhance meaningful connections between people. Not for control or manipulation, but to better understand the emotional intelligence we often take for granted.

I also work on AI systems that predict the future, not just in terms of numbers or trends, but behavior, preferences, and decision making patterns. Whether it's forecasting emotional responses in social platforms or anticipating actions in smart environments, I believe AI should be built to understand the full spectrum of human behavior. My research in future prediction blends deep learning with behavioral science to build models that are accurate, adaptive, and context aware.

In the field of machine learning and neural networks, I work with both traditional and cutting edge models, ranging from convolutional and recurrent neural networks to reinforcement learning systems. Iâ€™m especially drawn to creating learning systems that are explainable, flexible, and ethically sound. Iâ€™ve been exploring how we can merge symbolic AI with deep learning to make machines that donâ€™t just perform well but can also explain their reasoning in ways humans can understand.

When it comes to the Internet of Things (IoT), my focus is on intelligent environments, spaces that respond to our needs intuitively. I explore how connected devices can work together using shared intelligence, especially in smart homes, healthcare monitoring, and even romantic or social well being. Imagine a home that knows when youâ€™re feeling down and adjusts lighting, sound, or even sends the right message to someone you care about. Thatâ€™s the kind of future I want to help shape, one where technology supports human emotion, not replaces it.

One of the most exciting (and necessary) parts of my work is exploring the ethical side of AI. As we build systems that understand emotions and influence decisions, we have to ask tough questions. How do we protect privacy? How do we avoid manipulation? Whoâ€™s accountable when something goes wrong? I collaborate with ethicists, psychologists, and sociologists to make sure my work doesnâ€™t just push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible, it also respects the boundaries of whatâ€™s right.

Iâ€™ve published and presented my work internationally, contributed to interdisciplinary projects, and mentored students who are equally curious about the future of human machine interaction. I also work with industry partners on AI solutions that are both cutting edge and responsible. Whether itâ€™s building emotionally aware chatbots, designing AI powered matchmaking tools, or creating smart devices that learn from human cues, Iâ€™m always looking for ways to make AI more relatable, useful, and human.

At the heart of everything I do is a vision: to build empathetic, intelligent systems that donâ€™t just understand data, they understand us. Systems that help us connect better, live smarter, and feel more supported in a world increasingly shaped by algorithms.
